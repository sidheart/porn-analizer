# PornAnalizer
PornAnalizer is a tool which analyzes the frequency of keywords in Pornhub's 
top rated videos. It currently analyzes words from the first 10 pages of the
top rated section. The data is then displayed using d3 to produce a bubble chart.

## Running
Make sure you have Python 3 installed then simply run './pornAnalizer'
This will produce a file called results.csv. Opening index.html will
display the bubble chart. Note, this will only work on firefox. For chrome,
you have to run a webserver and access index.html via localhost.
